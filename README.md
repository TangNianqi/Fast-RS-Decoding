# Fast-RS-Decoding
This project provides a demo of fast decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes.
This project mainly focus on the correctness of proposed algorithm. Thus, the implementation is not established for fast software application.
Much efforts should be devoted if one wants to use the algorithm in a software application. For example, the field operations should be optimalized with respect to the target CPU.
"Fast algorithm" here means that the computation complexity is low. The proposed algorithm costs less field additions and multiplications.
